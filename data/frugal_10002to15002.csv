It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal.

It's frustrating that many hands-on options in high schools have been so neglected in public school systems. This isn't a ""back in my day"" rant; I'm a member of a generation where this stuff had already fallen by the wayside. I was subjected to a BS ""Life Skills"" class in high school. We practiced balancing a check book, which is fine but now nearly useless, especially since we did it by hand, while I now, like every sane person with any computer skill, use spreadsheets. We did a worksheet on buying a used car...by going to the computer lab and looking at cars on a used-car website. ""Pull out the dipstick and observe the oil for milkiness or irregularities"" said the worksheet, as we sat in the computer lab. ""What is the condition of the tires?"" next to a checkbox with options for ""yes"" and ""no.""

I learned how to maintain engines by watching and participating in it as it was done by my dad and the neighbor. Many people are not so privileged, but it's something that would have in decades past been covered in the first semester or two of an auto shop class in high school. Most of these sorts of tasks are not something which can be well understood except by participation. In decades past, most people would at least know one friend from high school who took that class and could either give a bit of guidance or, as I watched numerous times as a kid, come over and help (in exchange for some company and a few beers). Most of today's high schoolers will not have such an opportunity.

Similar ideas apply to home economics and making a decent scratch-cooked meal. Far from being a blow-off classes for deadbeats, as we treat them now, these were things that taught young people real skills. So many of my peers are shockingly reliant on access to restaurants and carry-out or delivery services or upon microwaved TV dinners that are barely palatable.

So here's my radical proposal: every high school student should have to prove out one or two basic life skills. One of them should be to cook a meal. Give them a budget, a basic kitchen, a simulated grocery shelf, some minimal nutrition standards, and some amount of time, to prepare dinner for themselves, a teacher, and a couple classmates.",1643080257,Public education and frugality,0,1.0
