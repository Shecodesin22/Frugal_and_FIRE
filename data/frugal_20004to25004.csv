This is a job literally only a handful of people in the USA &amp; maybe the same amount of people across the world are trained in.  I can't say more.  I will be doing this for less than a year (unless our company runs into some major hitch) and I'm doing this with adequate &amp; fair compensation from my company.

I'll be flying multiple times a month (likely at least once a week if not more), renting vehicles to move around, and possibly billing out meals/housing to the company.  My company is totally fine with me paying everything up front and reimbursing me.  

How do I make the most of this situation?  I'd like to travel internationally more in the future as a specific goal, but I'm open to capitalizing on this as much as I can in the limited time frame I have.  I currently have a Chase bank account and a Citi credit card but no rewards on it (got it right out of college several years ago).  I have a partner who might fly with me on occasion (comped by the company as part of the incentive to do this) and will probably occasionally take a small dog (not a flight-restricted breed, under 18lbs, has flown before) with me on flights that will allow when allowed (some locations are remote and having company for the week I'm there would be nice, also comped by the company).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I haven't really looked at this before because I'm very scared of getting into debt due to a family history of this.  I've kept myself afloat and am doing well right now, it's probably high time to adult up in this way.

So i took little courage and mailed to every possible customer support of samsung and even some officials. Somehow my mail reached to right guy with empathy and yesterday got a call from samsung to submit my phone to service centre.

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity! 

So what do you guys think I should do?

I managed to secure an internship for the summer, and it is fully remote. I am trying to figure out my options and can't decide where to stay.

1). My parent's home #2 

* Pro:  

   * House is empty (Parents moved out), so I will be living alone
   * No rent
   * normal cost-of-living
* Con:  

   * My parents sold the car when they moved. I will need to buy/rent a car for the summer
   * Still need to pay for utilities

2). My college town

* Pro:  

   * No need for cars; they have very good public transportation, and major grocery stores are nearby 
* Con:  

   * Need to pay rent; if I shop around, I might find a cheap apartment for the summer
   * Need to pay for utilities (?)

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful.

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.

I have a partner who might fly with me on occasion (comped by the company as part of the incentive to do this) and will probably occasionally take a small dog (not a flight-restricted breed, under 18lbs, has flown before) with me on flights that will allow when allowed (some locations are remote and having company for the week I'm there would be nice, also comped by the company).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I haven't really looked at this before because I'm very scared of getting into debt due to a family history of this.  I've kept myself afloat and am doing well right now, it's probably high time to adult up in this way.

I have an old Samsung m21 phone which was purcahsed in 2020, after one year or so it started to give hanging issues, i checked with local reapir shop as warranty was over, repair guy told me my phone motherboard is gone and will cost appx 120usd to repair, which i dont have anyway.

So i took little courage and mailed to every possible customer support of samsung and even some officials. Somehow my mail reached to right guy with empathy and yesterday got a call from samsung to submit my phone to service centre.

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity! 

So what do you guys think I should do?

I posted this in r/personalfinance but the responses weren't helpful. Maybe this subreddit could help. 

I managed to secure an internship for the summer, and it is fully remote. I am trying to figure out my options and can't decide where to stay.

1). My parent's home #2 

* Pro:  

   * House is empty (Parents moved out), so I will be living alone
   * No rent
   * normal cost-of-living
* Con:  

   * My parents sold the car when they moved. I will need to buy/rent a car for the summer
   * Still need to pay for utilities

2). My college town

* Pro:  

   * No need for cars; they have very good public transportation, and major grocery stores are nearby 
* Con:  

   * Need to pay rent; if I shop around, I might find a cheap apartment for the summer
   * Need to pay for utilities (?)

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I have an old Samsung m21 phone which was purcahsed in 2020, after one year or so it started to give hanging issues, i checked with local reapir shop as warranty was over, repair guy told me my phone motherboard is gone and will cost appx 120usd to repair, which i dont have anyway.

So i took little courage and mailed to every possible customer support of samsung and even some officials. Somehow my mail reached to right guy with empathy and yesterday got a call from samsung to submit my phone to service centre. 

Today they called again and told me that they can offer free motherboard replacement but i have insisted them to check one more time if they can replace full phone.

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity! 

So what do you guys think I should do?

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

Today they called again and told me that they can offer free motherboard replacement but i have insisted them to check one more time if they can replace full phone. 

Motherboard repair will solve the problem anyway. Lets see what happens tomorrow.",1642678199,My frugal attempt in getting free phone replacement from samsung.. ongoing,0,1.0

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

I can't drink milk tea, so I bought Thai tea packets instead, sweetened condensed coconut milk, and boba off Amazon. Total cost: around $2 a cup and some of my time.

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful.

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.

I adore makeup as a craft and artform and love to do it occasionally. Both beaty makeup and special effects makeup

(I do not think makeup should be something people should be expected to wear at work with the exception for example actors that might need makeup for a part)

My personal frugal tip is that if you only use makeup occasionally the best way to do it is to have dry products as far as possible.

Like cake mascara and cake eyeliner (you add water like you would with watercolors when you use then), and powder eyeshadow, powder foundations  etc.

This can last an hygienic way for decades (no fat or moisture means no bacterial growth).

This goes for special effects makeup as well. Go for alcohol activated makeup or water based makeup.

I can definitely drive it in my car (2013 Chevy Spark) problem is I can't fit EVERYTHING into my car because it's a tiny hatchback. I had a good plan going that my boyfriend was going to meet me down here, pack up the larger stuff in his car, and I take the smaller stuff and the pets, and we drive back together. No money on a U-Haul or anything just paying for gas. Unfortunately, he got covid and healed from that thankfully but is now going through what seems to be an upper respiratory infection from it so I'm just uncomfortable with him doing that drive twice and need to do this on my own. The problem is I need a good plan because my boyfriend is the type to just deal with it and do what he has to do to save money. It's honestly not worth his life, even potentially. 

Plan A was doing what I did when I was homeless a few years ago. Throw everyone and everything in the car and go. That was years ago though and I've accumulated stuff since. I've already parted with everything I can part with. I am doing a huge curb alert of just shit that 4 previous tenants have left behind and I only lived with and know 2 of them because I was related to them. I am already getting rid of EVERYTHING possible that's mine including ALL of my furniture besides my bed frame and computer desk and office chair because I work from home. 

Plan B I'm thinking is to rent a trailer for as little as I can and maybe tow it to my car or tow my car behind a truck, but the only option I know of is U-Haul and they want around $800 PLUS the miles which is going to cost me another $100 PLUS I'd have to install a hitch on my car and I've got MAYBE 3-400 I can spend on the move because I literally have until Friday to be outta here so I don't have time to wait for another check.

For context on what I'm bringing: I'm literally just bringing boxes, some paintings, pet supplies, my office chair and computer desk, and a king-sized bed frame. Not even bothering with the mattress. Some of the pet supplies are definitely not going to fit (like I have the biggest wire dog kennel you can get right now because my service animal is a shepsky) and my cat tree I can put in parts for sure, but it's a lot of space take-up. With my art, literally one of my paintings is the length of my trunk to my front seats and I don't wanna part with it. All of that plus my regular boxes of clothes and dishes and the such just won't all fit in a tiny chevy spark along with a whole ass human, a dog, and 2 cats.   


Any ideas? I also have some job discount benefits I can look up to go that route, but I don't think the savings would be big enough to fit a budget I can't expand on. Also don't have help.

As a result of that, I recently dropped and damaged the lid to my Iron Flask, and then discovered the company doesn't sell extra lids separately. I ordered a Hydro Flask instead, which cost about twice as much, but which do sell modular lids, and I also ordered some extra lids. Good thing I didn't recycle the Iron Flask before I got the lids, because it turns out they fit perfectly. So I'm keeping the Iron Flask for my indoor stuff with the plain lid and putting a straw lid on the Hydro Flask for outdoor use. 

The takeaway here is that anyone else who prefers the price point and pretty color gradient options on the Iron Flasks sold on Amazon, you can buy Hydro Flask lids for their smallmouth/standard size and use those.

So I was unfortunately laid off a while back, and while I'm trying very hard to find a job in my field, it's a slow process. In the meantime though, a guy's got bills to pay and a guy's gotta eat. My funds have started to run a little lower than I would like, so I started living in a far more frugal manner than previously and went over my expenses to see where I could trim some fat. 

After going over my budget, I realized that I was spending quite a bit on gas, so the logical conclusion was to stop driving so much. Unfortunately, I live in a city with subpar public transport, so it didn't seem like not driving was a viable option. However, the money that I was spending on gas was really taking its toll on my wallet, so I came up with a great idea: sell my car in favor of a more fuel-efficient vehicle to save money in the long run. 

So that's what I did! I sold my car in a rather abrupt manner (see ya Betty!), and set about purchasing a more fuel-efficient auto, as it were. Unfortunately, I've never been one to plan ahead and do, what do you call it, research, so I went into the purchasing process a little blind. Not quite blind-blind mind you, but more like Daredevil-blind in the sense that I did have a vague idea of what I was getting myself into. 

Long story short: sticker shock! After browsing fuel-efficient automobiles that would allow my plan to work and save me gas money in the long run, I realized that I don't feel comfortable spending the money it takes to obtain these vehicles. I could do it if I wanted to, but I would be cutting it a bit closer than I would like. So in the meantime, I'm left with plenty of gas money but no car, and in a city where having a car is a damn near necessity!

We just had Christmas a few weeks ago. I said I didn't want anything. I honestly truly don't. Receiving gifts makes me feel depressed somehow. The gifts I received are still in a pile in the living room. If I let my family see my home, they criticize me for being messy, even calling me a hoarder. Because I don't know what to do when I receive things I don't want. I just put them in a box and put them in my basement for storage and if I'm lucky, I figure out a place to return it or someone to give it to, who will appreciate it. I just want to call out here: I'm called a hoarder by people who bring things into my house without my consent. I'm so uncomfortable that I cried, privately.

I like picking out my own stuff. I hate throwing things away because I hate waste. Since I hate throwing things away, I insist on curating my own items so that they suit my needs and taste. Here's some things I received that I don't know what to do with:

Designer handbag - I have more bags, totes, small luggage than I need and feel morally opposed to hundreds of dollars being spent on things that get used and abused. No it's not very durable and it's not my style. Nothing in my wardrobe is this color scheme.

Pajamas - they are not my style, and I have more than I actually wear and my closet is full.

Wax warmer and scented wax from MLM - strong fragrances make my head hurt

Before the holidays, to prevent repeats of previous years, I also insisted that no one buy me candy. I still have containers I haven't eaten. Diabetes is so prevalent in the family, I don't even want the temptation. Thankfully I got minimal. Unfortunately I got other things instead.

I just don't like money being spent on me. Now I'm spending my time fretting and figuring out where to put these things or who could use them. I find our commercial consumerism terrifying and wasteful. All I want is to save enough money to retire ASAP because the last thing I want is more stuff and what I want more than anything in the world is for my time to mine and not be bound to a corporate employer.",1642545275,Feeling uncomfortable about receiving gifts,0,1.0

The top-of-the-line Sherwin Williams paint sold at Lowe's (""Infinity"") ***guarantees*** ""one coat coverage.""  It is a very nice paint, but, unsurprisingly, it does *not* offer one-coat coverage--unless you are painting some version of white over another version of white.  In my experience, even white over beige requires two coats.  Thus, you will probably be entitled to a refund.

If you are painting a residential interior, I suggest the following:

1. Buy enough paint for two coats.  Save your receipt.  
2. Prep the walls according to the instructions on the can.
3. Paint one coat (again, following instructions) and let dry.  (Note:  Even a final coat will look splotchy while wet; you MUST let dry before concluding that coverage was inadequate.)
4. If/when you can still see through this first coat, take photos.  
5. Finish the job.  Save all cans and unused paint. 
6. If first coat was inadequate, invoke the guarantee per the instructions on the can and collect your refund.  **BE HONEST**.  

That's it.  

I have used this paint in my entire house, doing some rooms myself and hiring a professional for the main living areas.  I have used very dark blue, baby blue, lavender, two whites, and hunter green.  One coat *never* did the trick, and I have been fully reimbursed by SW for almost $700 in paint.
