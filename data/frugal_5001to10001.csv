We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

What I've learned is that I cannot brute-force myself (or my partner) into frugality. The best methods for us have been to make things habit-based or automated.  


* Some things I've done in the past:
   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

I was having a conversation with my mom the other day about the temperature we keep our places at. She was absolutely floored that I have never turned the heat on in my apartment in the winter. We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol. I reminded her that cold weather isn't what makes people sick, but now I'm second guessing given everything I've found on the internet regarding the subject so far?

What I've learned is that I cannot brute-force myself (or my partner) into frugality. The best methods for us have been to make things habit-based or automated.

   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

This woman had a collective of ladies that pitched in to buy a salon hair dryer chair and they all would use it in her house instead of going to a salon.   


The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry. She also uses dresser drawers with a blanket tucked in the bottom for a makeshift crib if a great grandchild visits. She is 94 at this point.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry. She also uses dresser drawers with a blanket tucked in the bottom for a makeshift crib if a great grandchild visits. She is 94 at this point.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

The other day, the glass carafe of my French press broke when I accidentally dropped it in the sink while washing it. Two small parts at the top of it broke off.

What I've learned is that I cannot brute-force myself (or my partner) into frugality. The best methods for us have been to make things habit-based or automated.  


* Some things I've done in the past:
   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

 I'm also disabled with severe illness and my phone is my ""second brain"" now....it's my memory (through photos and alarms) and my communication when I'm bedbound. Battery is important too, it's a safety issue for me to be too low. 

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media. 

I am quite broke from medical bills, but frugal scrappiness has seen me through! That said, I have the business savings to buy this as an investment. I've always squeezed the maximum life out of my Apple products (currently rocking a 7yo laptop and iPhone 6s). I want this to be a best bang-for-buck purchase.

I flagged this BIFL even though a phone will never last THAT long, but that's the attitude I'm shopping with. 

I don't think I need a huge tablet-size phone but talk to me if you came to love yours. 

Also...curious about any deals? I plan to buy this as a business purchase but am tempted to buy it personally through the AppleCard deal since I'm working less these days and that may be more IRS friendly anyway. Any other great opportunities? I tend to go unlocked since I'm on a rock-bottom Verizon plan but I may switch to Mint.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

What I've learned is that I cannot brute-force myself (or my partner) into frugality. The best methods for us have been to make things habit-based or automated.  


* Some things I've done in the past:
   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

* Some things I've done in the past:
   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

 I'm also disabled with severe illness and my phone is my ""second brain"" now....it's my memory (through photos and alarms) and my communication when I'm bedbound. Battery is important too, it's a safety issue for me to be too low. 

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media. 

I am quite broke from medical bills, but frugal scrappiness has seen me through! That said, I have the business savings to buy this as an investment. I've always squeezed the maximum life out of my Apple products (currently rocking a 7yo laptop and iPhone 6s). I want this to be a best bang-for-buck purchase.

I flagged this BIFL even though a phone will never last THAT long, but that's the attitude I'm shopping with.

Also...curious about any deals? I plan to buy this as a business purchase but am tempted to buy it personally through the AppleCard deal since I'm working less these days and that may be more IRS friendly anyway.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

 I'm also disabled with severe illness and my phone is my ""second brain"" now....it's my memory (through photos and alarms) and my communication when I'm bedbound. Battery is important too, it's a safety issue for me to be too low. 

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media.

I flagged this BIFL even though a phone will never last THAT long, but that's the attitude I'm shopping with.

Also...curious about any deals?

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

This woman had a collective of ladies that pitched in to buy a salon hair dryer chair and they all would use it in her house instead of going to a salon.   


The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me.

We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

What I've learned is that I cannot brute-force myself (or my partner) into frugality. The best methods for us have been to make things habit-based or automated.  


* Some things I've done in the past:
   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

I know my wife too well. The moment she is there she will want to go shopping this and that and it will add up. This whole shit will be put on credits cards since we have nothing saved

Sucks because we just got out of debt from a trip qe did last may. I dont think its appropriate to go through the same thing again.

I told my wife she can use my travel points that could cover her ticket but i dont want to go. Of course i am being labeled as boring and antisocial.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol. I reminded her that cold weather isn't what makes people sick, but now I'm second guessing given everything I've found on the internet regarding the subject so far?

   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry. She also uses dresser drawers with a blanket tucked in the bottom for a makeshift crib if a great grandchild visits. She is 94 at this point.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

I have started participating in brave rewards even though I don't have a wallet. I am searching for giveaways, given that I am lazy enough to not participate in those tho.

But still, my focus is diverted from the real thing. LEARN then EARN. How do I make up my mind about this issue?

Some other Ideas for generating money for me are starting a blog and using various ad companies placement and earning money. Which I feel is free money kind of. If I started a youtube channel, I would respect myself, but won't do it, because my brain doesn't think it is free money.

What I've learned is that I cannot brute-force myself (or my partner) into frugality. The best methods for us have been to make things habit-based or automated.

   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.

My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Shipping smaller/lighter items like clothes through UPS is cheaper than hiring a mover/renting a portable storage unit, but I worry about the safety of that as I will have to ship multiple medium-large boxes and who knows where they could end up.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

* Some things I've done in the past:
   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.

 I'm also disabled with severe illness and my phone is my ""second brain"" now....it's my memory (through photos and alarms) and my communication when I'm bedbound. Battery is important too, it's a safety issue for me to be too low. 

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

What I've learned is that I cannot brute-force myself (or my partner) into frugality. The best methods for us have been to make things habit-based or automated.  


* Some things I've done in the past:
   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

 I'm also disabled with severe illness and my phone is my ""second brain"" now....it's my memory (through photos and alarms) and my communication when I'm bedbound. Battery is important too, it's a safety issue for me to be too low. 

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

 I'm also disabled with severe illness and my phone is my ""second brain"" now....it's my memory (through photos and alarms) and my communication when I'm bedbound. Battery is important too, it's a safety issue for me to be too low. 

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media. 

I am quite broke from medical bills, but frugal scrappiness has seen me through! That said, I have the business savings to buy this as an investment. I've always squeezed the maximum life out of my Apple products (currently rocking a 7yo laptop and iPhone 6s). I want this to be a best bang-for-buck purchase. If there's not a huge diff between a refurbed 11 and a 13, cool, I'll get the 11. If the 13 is the better long-term investment, then I'll get the 13. Open to SE but not sure there's enough storage. I flagged this BIFL even though a phone will never last THAT long, but that's the attitude I'm shopping with. 

I don't think I need a huge tablet-size phone but talk to me if you came to love yours. 

Also...curious about any deals? I plan to buy this as a business purchase but am tempted to buy it personally through the AppleCard deal since I'm working less these days and that may be more IRS friendly anyway.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media.

Also...curious about any deals?

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

This woman had a collective of ladies that pitched in to buy a salon hair dryer chair and they all would use it in her house instead of going to a salon.   


The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband.

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.

My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

I was having a conversation with my mom the other day about the temperature we keep our places at. She was absolutely floored that I have never turned the heat on in my apartment in the winter. We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol. I reminded her that cold weather isn't what makes people sick, but now I'm second guessing given everything I've found on the internet regarding the subject so far?

   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

This woman had a collective of ladies that pitched in to buy a salon hair dryer chair and they all would use it in her house instead of going to a salon.   


The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry. She also uses dresser drawers with a blanket tucked in the bottom for a makeshift crib if a great grandchild visits. She is 94 at this point.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week

   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

One of the older ladies would eat flowers she grew on her front porch. This woman had a collective of ladies that pitched in to buy a salon hair dryer chair and they all would use it in her house instead of going to a salon.   


The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry. She also uses dresser drawers with a blanket tucked in the bottom for a makeshift crib if a great grandchild visits. She is 94 at this point.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

It looks like selling my car +flying is the cheapest route, but I do have a little bit more stuff than what can fit in two or 3 checked bags. (Why is it so hard to part with plastic bins and containers??)

Shipping smaller/lighter items like clothes through UPS is cheaper than hiring a mover/renting a portable storage unit, but I worry about the safety of that as I will have to ship multiple medium-large boxes and who knows where they could end up. The largest/heaviest thing I own is a small sewing machine that I would prefer to keep over selling it.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

* Some things I've done in the past:
   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

 I'm also disabled with severe illness and my phone is my ""second brain"" now....it's my memory (through photos and alarms) and my communication when I'm bedbound. Battery is important too, it's a safety issue for me to be too low. 

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

This is made worse by being DINK with pretty high incomes. It's been a consistent slow effort over the years to reduce my overhead. Much of my spending/choices will seem ridiculous to some of you guys (food is the absolute worse), but I'm always making an effort.  


What I've learned is that I cannot brute-force myself (or my partner) into frugality. The best methods for us have been to make things habit-based or automated.  


* Some things I've done in the past:
   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

 I'm also disabled with severe illness and my phone is my ""second brain"" now....it's my memory (through photos and alarms) and my communication when I'm bedbound. Battery is important too, it's a safety issue for me to be too low. 

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media. 

I am quite broke from medical bills, but frugal scrappiness has seen me through! That said, I have the business savings to buy this as an investment. I've always squeezed the maximum life out of my Apple products (currently rocking a 7yo laptop and iPhone 6s). I want this to be a best bang-for-buck purchase.

I flagged this BIFL even though a phone will never last THAT long, but that's the attitude I'm shopping with.

Also...curious about any deals? I plan to buy this as a business purchase but am tempted to buy it personally through the AppleCard deal since I'm working less these days and that may be more IRS friendly anyway.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

I've always squeezed the maximum life out of my Apple products (currently rocking a 7yo laptop and iPhone 6s). I want this to be a best bang-for-buck purchase. If there's not a huge diff between a refurbed 11 and a 13, cool, I'll get the 11. If the 13 is the better long-term investment, then I'll get the 13. Open to SE but not sure there's enough storage. I flagged this BIFL even though a phone will never last THAT long, but that's the attitude I'm shopping with. 

I don't think I need a huge tablet-size phone but talk to me if you came to love yours. 

Also...curious about any deals? I plan to buy this as a business purchase but am tempted to buy it personally through the AppleCard deal since I'm working less these days and that may be more IRS friendly anyway. Any other great opportunities? I tend to go unlocked since I'm on a rock-bottom Verizon plan but I may switch to Mint.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

This woman had a collective of ladies that pitched in to buy a salon hair dryer chair and they all would use it in her house instead of going to a salon.   


The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry. She also uses dresser drawers with a blanket tucked in the bottom for a makeshift crib if a great grandchild visits. She is 94 at this point.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help.

Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week

   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

This woman had a collective of ladies that pitched in to buy a salon hair dryer chair and they all would use it in her house instead of going to a salon.   


The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

What I've learned is that I cannot brute-force myself (or my partner) into frugality. The best methods for us have been to make things habit-based or automated.  


* Some things I've done in the past:
   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

The idea of throwing away something not damaged is very mind-boggling to me in general. Finding out that even THRIFT stores do it is crazy.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

I was having a conversation with my mom the other day about the temperature we keep our places at. She was absolutely floored that I have never turned the heat on in my apartment in the winter. We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

I was having a conversation with my mom the other day about the temperature we keep our places at. She was absolutely floored that I have never turned the heat on in my apartment in the winter. We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

One of the older ladies would eat flowers she grew on her front porch. This woman had a collective of ladies that pitched in to buy a salon hair dryer chair and they all would use it in her house instead of going to a salon.   


The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry. She also uses dresser drawers with a blanket tucked in the bottom for a makeshift crib if a great grandchild visits. She is 94 at this point.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

Shipping smaller/lighter items like clothes through UPS is cheaper than hiring a mover/renting a portable storage unit, but I worry about the safety of that as I will have to ship multiple medium-large boxes and who knows where they could end up.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

* Some things I've done in the past:
   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.

 I'm also disabled with severe illness and my phone is my ""second brain"" now....it's my memory (through photos and alarms) and my communication when I'm bedbound. Battery is important too, it's a safety issue for me to be too low. 

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

What I've learned is that I cannot brute-force myself (or my partner) into frugality. The best methods for us have been to make things habit-based or automated.  


* Some things I've done in the past:
   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

 I'm also disabled with severe illness and my phone is my ""second brain"" now....it's my memory (through photos and alarms) and my communication when I'm bedbound. Battery is important too, it's a safety issue for me to be too low. 

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

 I'm also disabled with severe illness and my phone is my ""second brain"" now....it's my memory (through photos and alarms) and my communication when I'm bedbound. Battery is important too, it's a safety issue for me to be too low. 

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media. 

I am quite broke from medical bills, but frugal scrappiness has seen me through! That said, I have the business savings to buy this as an investment. I've always squeezed the maximum life out of my Apple products (currently rocking a 7yo laptop and iPhone 6s). I want this to be a best bang-for-buck purchase. If there's not a huge diff between a refurbed 11 and a 13, cool, I'll get the 11. If the 13 is the better long-term investment, then I'll get the 13. Open to SE but not sure there's enough storage. I flagged this BIFL even though a phone will never last THAT long, but that's the attitude I'm shopping with. 

I don't think I need a huge tablet-size phone but talk to me if you came to love yours. 

Also...curious about any deals? I plan to buy this as a business purchase but am tempted to buy it personally through the AppleCard deal since I'm working less these days and that may be more IRS friendly anyway.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media.

Also...curious about any deals?

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

This woman had a collective of ladies that pitched in to buy a salon hair dryer chair and they all would use it in her house instead of going to a salon.   


The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband.

We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.

My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Remove one-click buy from amazon
   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

This woman had a collective of ladies that pitched in to buy a salon hair dryer chair and they all would use it in her house instead of going to a salon.   


The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

I was having a conversation with my mom the other day about the temperature we keep our places at. She was absolutely floored that I have never turned the heat on in my apartment in the winter. We both live in a subtropical climate but the two months of the year where temp's outside drop below 50°F regularly (usually at night) is Jan-Feb. The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol. I reminded her that cold weather isn't what makes people sick, but now I'm second guessing given everything I've found on the internet regarding the subject so far?

   * Auto-pay bills
   * Automate savings and investments
   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week
   * Default set of ""template"" meals that are customizable and pantry-based and allow me to reduce food waste  

* Some things I plan to do:
   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

This woman had a collective of ladies that pitched in to buy a salon hair dryer chair and they all would use it in her house instead of going to a salon.   


The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry. She also uses dresser drawers with a blanket tucked in the bottom for a makeshift crib if a great grandchild visits. She is 94 at this point.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Have a default grocery list that I use every week and only shop one day a week

   * Switch my weekly grocery store from Whole Foods to Walmart (I know, I know. I justified WF for a long time)
   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)
   * Add some filters to phone/internet to try to eliminate advertisements and cultivate more frugal hobbies like hiking, reading, and drawing.

 &amp;nbsp;

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

One of the older ladies would eat flowers she grew on her front porch. This woman had a collective of ladies that pitched in to buy a salon hair dryer chair and they all would use it in her house instead of going to a salon.   


The other lady tended to her own 10 x 10 garden and canned the produce. She had a wall unit for cold air in the summer and a separate wall unit for heat in the winter, but only in the living room of the house. She also rarely owned single use items and used wash rags instead of paper towels.  


My wife's grandmother had 8 children and was given an allowance of $80 a week to feed them. She would make pancakes and instead of buying maple syrup, she would boil water with white sugar and add maple extract. This went far and was delicious.   


My wife's other grandmother vacuums her air filters instead of replacing them. She also freezes fresh fruit when it is cheap and in season so that she can use it throughout the year.  


My grandmother saves food far too long and cuts the mold off of food before eating the non-moldy parts. She washes her clothes in the bathtub and hangs them to dry. She also uses dresser drawers with a blanket tucked in the bottom for a makeshift crib if a great grandchild visits. She is 94 at this point.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

It looks like selling my car +flying is the cheapest route, but I do have a little bit more stuff than what can fit in two or 3 checked bags. (Why is it so hard to part with plastic bins and containers??)

Shipping smaller/lighter items like clothes through UPS is cheaper than hiring a mover/renting a portable storage unit, but I worry about the safety of that as I will have to ship multiple medium-large boxes and who knows where they could end up. The largest/heaviest thing I own is a small sewing machine that I would prefer to keep over selling it.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0

The average temp in my apartment is thus around 64°F during the day, and 60°F at night.

She knows I rarely use the AC, too, so I didn't think it was much of a surprise but she was concerned I would be more susceptible to catching a cold/COVID etc. if I continue to do this. Lol.

   * Add more frozen meals to my weekly shopping list to prevent fourthmeal fast food runs and in case I forget to pack lunch/breakfast (I work variable hours - mostly nights)

You can pretty much make any of their [large specialty pizzas ](https://i.imgur.com/Vca9tlb.jpg) for $8.74.
[And that price with the slash ](https://i.imgur.com/CBZB9pX.jpg) is what this pizza would be normally, and it’s not even a true “specialty” option as it’s just coming very close to “recreating” one of the specialty pizzas on the menu. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Here’s what the “specialty” version of the BBQ chicken pizza would be](https://i.imgur.com/uZmeavf.jpg)
Now, granted, there is a coupon in that same section for “any specialty pizza for $13.99”, but you can almost literally create any of the specialty pizza options through the “create your own” option, minus maybe one topping in most cases. 
[For example…](https://i.imgur.com/OLIv7bm.jpg)
The specialty BBQ chicken (Memphis) shown in that screenshot for $17.99 (normally this without a coupon) has the topping of BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, and the last two toppings are shown above.
My “create your own” version has jalapeño peppers rather than one of the two remains cheeses which the specialty normally has, but I could have picked one of those extra cheese toppings, (a different type of cheese on top of the usual cheese is what it is) and I’d be one extra cheese type away from a pizza they want to charge $17.99 for, an extra $9.26 FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF EXTRA CHEESE. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here’s your lesson into how to not get ripped off when they’re literally throwing a half off deal in your face every single day, for as many pizzas as you’d like, for years now.

 I'm also disabled with severe illness and my phone is my ""second brain"" now....it's my memory (through photos and alarms) and my communication when I'm bedbound. Battery is important too, it's a safety issue for me to be too low. 

My current career is suffering due to health, but I hope to be able to use my phone to produce content (video/photography) so I'd love a camera/video upgrade. (No...not THAT kind of content. Mind outta the gutter.) Mostly portrait, video, editing, and social media. 

I am quite broke from medical bills, but frugal scrappiness has seen me through! That said, I have the business savings to buy this as an investment. I've always squeezed the maximum life out of my Apple products (currently rocking a 7yo laptop and iPhone 6s). I want this to be a best bang-for-buck purchase. If there's not a huge diff between a refurbed 11 and a 13, cool, I'll get the 11. If the 13 is the better long-term investment, then I'll get the 13. Open to SE but not sure there's enough storage. I flagged this BIFL even though a phone will never last THAT long, but that's the attitude I'm shopping with. 

I don't think I need a huge tablet-size phone but talk to me if you came to love yours. 

Also...curious about any deals? I plan to buy this as a business purchase but am tempted to buy it personally through the AppleCard deal since I'm working less these days and that may be more IRS friendly anyway. Any other great opportunities? I tend to go unlocked since I'm on a rock-bottom Verizon plan but I may switch to Mint.

Go through your budget and put your expenses into categories. Then examine expenditures within those categories from there. 

An example from my life: The largest expenses in my budget are my mortgage, food, purchases for the home(pets, household items like toilet paper, etc.) and then gas. 

When I am trying to save more money, I look at food, home purchases, and gas first. 

I made a separate post quite some time ago about how adopting a frugal mindset should make your life better- aside from saving money. Less stress, more time, removing a dreaded task from your list of things to do. It should not be ""one more thing to do"" or yet another stressor to endure. Think about the full picture of your lifestyle and how thinking frugally can help. 

An example of something I have done recently, tying these thoughts together:

I drive about 45 minutes(\~26 miles) to and from work 5 days a week. Beginning last summer, I started teleworking 1 day per week, without realizing that the policy at my workplace is that I would be eligible to telework up to 3 days per week. My job is public-facing, so I was hesitant not to be at my office any more than that. However, I worked with my colleagues and supervisor to figure out a way that I could telework an additional day each week, rearranging my tasks so I could do more at home with my schedule. 

I love working at home, so there are many benefits for me for doing this besides not having to drive 50+ more miles a day and spending an hour and a half in the car. I don't have to wake up so early, rush around to get out the door, or keep up with as much laundry due to wearing my work uniform more. I can spend more time with my pets and husband. It's mentally much better for me. 

But also, there's many hidden financial savings. I'd estimate that 50 miles is about $8 of gas. So on top of the other benefits, I'm saving $32 +additional maintenance on my car each month. That's enough to pay for 2 of my streaming services. 

I'd highly recommend this top-down approach. The small expenditures might be easier to see day to day, but I think it can be more stressful too, if you're spending a lot of time and energy if you're not looking at the big picture first.",1643253889,"Advice: Remember to ""Chop from the Top""",0,1.0
