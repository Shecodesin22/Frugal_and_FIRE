Even I know this is a poor design choice, but their loss is our frugal gain!  These phones with cracked backs are typically available on Ebay for 75% of new price!  And there is almost nothing wrong with them!    


You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.    


Here is the list I have of Motorola phones with glass back covers, that you'll probably find cheap on ebay

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.

My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

When I mentioned this to a relative of mine they said it was no wonder we eat as well as we do since it never would have occurred to them to do the same and how they would've probably just spent it all on snacks for lack of anything better to buy.

And there is almost nothing wrong with them!    


You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.

I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.

I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

Eventually I was able to get out of debt by strict budgeting.  *Extremely strict budgeting*.  With that I was able to buy a condo, and start saving some money on top.

But for the past few years I've been making more than I need, and I've been putting the savings into paying down my mortgage faster, and starting saving for retirement.

Starting from this month, I will be now making more money than I know what to do with.  I won't be rich by any standard, but I will be pretty comfortable and can start spending on some luxuries.

The thing is, because of my years of struck budgeting and penny-pinching, I don't know how to spend money.  For example, my credit card bill for January is going to be around $170, and that's pretty much just gas and internet.  It's like a challenge for myself to spend the least amount of money possible every month.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

When I mentioned this to a relative of mine they said it was no wonder we eat as well as we do since it never would have occurred to them to do the same and how they would've probably just spent it all on snacks for lack of anything better to buy.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I have been working on decluttering my house (simplifying, you know) and so I have mostly used it to give away things to people who are interested, but I have used it a few times to ask for things, too.  


I found a metal tchotchke at a thrift store last week.  It's white, but I want to spray paint it red.  I asked the Buy Nothing group if anyone had a used can of red spray paint that they might be willing to give to me, and within an hour, someone said that they did.  I picked it up at her house the next time I was down in town.  Now I don't have to go out and buy a can of red spray paint that I would probably only use once and then it would just sit on a shelf in the garage gathering dust.  


It's really nice to know that you are able to help people and to receive help on these groups.  Ours is wonderful.  One of the admins just had premature twins and people in the group came to the rescue and made sure that she had premie baby clothes, diapers, and they even brought meals to her.  It was really heartwarming.  Anyway, check to see if there's a Buy Nothing group in your area.  I highly recommend them.",1643595214,"If you haven't heard of a Buy Nothing group before, I'm here to shout its praises!",0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.

I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.

We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I have been working on decluttering my house (simplifying, you know) and so I have mostly used it to give away things to people who are interested, but I have used it a few times to ask for things, too.  


I found a metal tchotchke at a thrift store last week.  It's white, but I want to spray paint it red.  I asked the Buy Nothing group if anyone had a used can of red spray paint that they might be willing to give to me, and within an hour, someone said that they did.  I picked it up at her house the next time I was down in town.  Now I don't have to go out and buy a can of red spray paint that I would probably only use once and then it would just sit on a shelf in the garage gathering dust.  


It's really nice to know that you are able to help people and to receive help on these groups.  Ours is wonderful.  One of the admins just had premature twins and people in the group came to the rescue and made sure that she had premie baby clothes, diapers, and they even brought meals to her.

Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

Now I don't have to go out and buy a can of red spray paint that I would probably only use once and then it would just sit on a shelf in the garage gathering dust.

Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

I'm currently working from home, and I also work on two projects as a freelancer. Just my luck, my computer, which I bought almost three years ago, has begun to glitch when it comes to my work tasks. It's not essential, but it causes a certain discomfort and somewhat slows down my work, not to mention the fact that it dramatically spoils my mood. It's pretty annoying that I have to wait almost five minutes to open a program and start working.

I took it to a repair shop for checking, and they told me it could be upgraded for $500, but they only give a three-month warranty. My friends say that such improvements aren't very reasonable in most cases, and in half a year, I'll still have to buy a new one, losing the $500 invested in the upgrade.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

&amp;#x200B;

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month. I feel that if I do it, all the time spent on finding tips for saving money on Walmart or Costco shopping is wasted. I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

I took it to a repair shop for checking, and they told me it could be upgraded for $500, but they only give a three-month warranty.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month. I feel that if I do it, all the time spent on finding tips for saving money on Walmart or Costco shopping is wasted. I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far.

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

It was just the same with the coal: if they had been able to afford it, they could have bought a ton of the same class of coal for twenty-six shillings, but buying it as they did, by the hundredweight, they had to pay at the rate of thirty-three shillings and fourpence a ton.

I took it to a repair shop for checking, and they told me it could be upgraded for $500, but they only give a three-month warranty.

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.  (Yes, I know...that's rather silly that I didn't think of that, huh?)  


I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.  Almost without exception, they will send you coupons.

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.  (Yes, I know...that's rather silly that I didn't think of that, huh?)  


I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.  Almost without exception, they will send you coupons.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.  (Yes, I know...that's rather silly that I didn't think of that, huh?)  


I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit.

I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I can also get delivery from Walmart.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.

I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

And there is almost nothing wrong with them!    


You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.    


Here is the list I have of Motorola phones with glass back covers, that you'll probably find cheap on ebay

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.

I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

When I mentioned this to a relative of mine they said it was no wonder we eat as well as we do since it never would have occurred to them to do the same and how they would've probably just spent it all on snacks for lack of anything better to buy.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.

I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.

We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

When I mentioned this to a relative of mine they said it was no wonder we eat as well as we do since it never would have occurred to them to do the same and how they would've probably just spent it all on snacks for lack of anything better to buy.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I did a search to see if we had one in my area and we did.  I joined it on Facebook.  A Buy Nothing group is where people both give away and ask for things that they might need -- and they are all FREE!  I have been working on decluttering my house (simplifying, you know) and so I have mostly used it to give away things to people who are interested, but I have used it a few times to ask for things, too.  


I found a metal tchotchke at a thrift store last week.  It's white, but I want to spray paint it red.  I asked the Buy Nothing group if anyone had a used can of red spray paint that they might be willing to give to me, and within an hour, someone said that they did.  I picked it up at her house the next time I was down in town.  Now I don't have to go out and buy a can of red spray paint that I would probably only use once and then it would just sit on a shelf in the garage gathering dust.  


It's really nice to know that you are able to help people and to receive help on these groups.  Ours is wonderful.  One of the admins just had premature twins and people in the group came to the rescue and made sure that she had premie baby clothes, diapers, and they even brought meals to her.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!

My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

I live in a small house close to my campus and park my car outside the side of the house.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

Now I don't have to go out and buy a can of red spray paint that I would probably only use once and then it would just sit on a shelf in the garage gathering dust.

Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

I'm currently working from home, and I also work on two projects as a freelancer. Just my luck, my computer, which I bought almost three years ago, has begun to glitch when it comes to my work tasks. It's not essential, but it causes a certain discomfort and somewhat slows down my work, not to mention the fact that it dramatically spoils my mood. It's pretty annoying that I have to wait almost five minutes to open a program and start working. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took it to a repair shop for checking, and they told me it could be upgraded for $500, but they only give a three-month warranty. My friends say that such improvements aren't very reasonable in most cases, and in half a year, I'll still have to buy a new one, losing the $500 invested in the upgrade.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

&amp;#x200B;

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month. I feel that if I do it, all the time spent on finding tips for saving money on Walmart or Costco shopping is wasted. I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

It's pretty annoying that I have to wait almost five minutes to open a program and start working.

I took it to a repair shop for checking, and they told me it could be upgraded for $500, but they only give a three-month warranty.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

&amp;#x200B;

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month. I feel that if I do it, all the time spent on finding tips for saving money on Walmart or Costco shopping is wasted. I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far.

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

It's not essential, but it causes a certain discomfort and somewhat slows down my work, not to mention the fact that it dramatically spoils my mood. It's pretty annoying that I have to wait almost five minutes to open a program and start working.

I took it to a repair shop for checking, and they told me it could be upgraded for $500, but they only give a three-month warranty. My friends say that such improvements aren't very reasonable in most cases, and in half a year, I'll still have to buy a new one, losing the $500 invested in the upgrade.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

&amp;#x200B;

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month. I feel that if I do it, all the time spent on finding tips for saving money on Walmart or Costco shopping is wasted. I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far.

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.  Almost without exception, they will send you coupons.

I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.  (Yes, I know...that's rather silly that I didn't think of that, huh?)  


I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.  Almost without exception, they will send you coupons.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.  (Yes, I know...that's rather silly that I didn't think of that, huh?)  


I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.

Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I'm semi-okay with ordering other meats from Walmart, they seem to have ""ok"" chicken and pork for some things.

Mostly I need ground beef/chuck and maybe something like beef tips but I do want to get some chicken and pork.

Optimally I'd like to get all that I need (other non-meat food items included) in one order just because I can't afford delivery charges and tips very often. If I have to though I'll get meat from one place and other items from a walmart delivery if that's the top suggestion.

Any suggestions on which store to shop for beef/ground beef products?  I'm fairly inexperienced with grocery shopping, mom died on christmas eve and now a month later the food in the kitchen is starting to become scarce so I need to figure something out but I need to watch how much I spend and make sure what I get is reasonably good and not a waste of money.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.  (Yes, I know...that's rather silly that I didn't think of that, huh?)  


I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

Even I know this is a poor design choice, but their loss is our frugal gain!  These phones with cracked backs are typically available on Ebay for 75% of new price!  And there is almost nothing wrong with them!    


You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.    


Here is the list I have of Motorola phones with glass back covers, that you'll probably find cheap on ebay

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.

I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

When I mentioned this to a relative of mine they said it was no wonder we eat as well as we do since it never would have occurred to them to do the same and how they would've probably just spent it all on snacks for lack of anything better to buy.

And there is almost nothing wrong with them!    


You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.

I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.

I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

The thing is, because of my years of struck budgeting and penny-pinching, I don't know how to spend money.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

When I mentioned this to a relative of mine they said it was no wonder we eat as well as we do since it never would have occurred to them to do the same and how they would've probably just spent it all on snacks for lack of anything better to buy.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I have been working on decluttering my house (simplifying, you know) and so I have mostly used it to give away things to people who are interested, but I have used it a few times to ask for things, too.  


I found a metal tchotchke at a thrift store last week.  It's white, but I want to spray paint it red.  I asked the Buy Nothing group if anyone had a used can of red spray paint that they might be willing to give to me, and within an hour, someone said that they did.  I picked it up at her house the next time I was down in town.  Now I don't have to go out and buy a can of red spray paint that I would probably only use once and then it would just sit on a shelf in the garage gathering dust.  


It's really nice to know that you are able to help people and to receive help on these groups.  Ours is wonderful.  One of the admins just had premature twins and people in the group came to the rescue and made sure that she had premie baby clothes, diapers, and they even brought meals to her.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).

My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

I immediately knew it was stolen and needed to file a report but I procrastinated mostly due to thinking it was a homeless person stealing it and telling myself I was going to stop leaving my possessions of value in my car. 
Well smart fucking me last night, after an 8hour shift, I drop off my manager to her house and go home forgetting I had my backpack in my car. I go check on it at 4 today and it’s fucking gone with my university borrowed laptop, my iPad i bought 2 years ago and all my school notebooks. I’m pretty sure it was the same person, and they left a cheap cloth bag in my front passengers seat like a piece of shit (I’m pretty sure it was on purpose by that point to leave it)

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I picked it up at her house the next time I was down in town.  Now I don't have to go out and buy a can of red spray paint that I would probably only use once and then it would just sit on a shelf in the garage gathering dust.  


It's really nice to know that you are able to help people and to receive help on these groups.  Ours is wonderful.  One of the admins just had premature twins and people in the group came to the rescue and made sure that she had premie baby clothes, diapers, and they even brought meals to her.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!

My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

My friends say that such improvements aren't very reasonable in most cases, and in half a year, I'll still have to buy a new one, losing the $500 invested in the upgrade.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

&amp;#x200B;

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month. I feel that if I do it, all the time spent on finding tips for saving money on Walmart or Costco shopping is wasted. I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

It's not essential, but it causes a certain discomfort and somewhat slows down my work, not to mention the fact that it dramatically spoils my mood. It's pretty annoying that I have to wait almost five minutes to open a program and start working.

I took it to a repair shop for checking, and they told me it could be upgraded for $500, but they only give a three-month warranty. My friends say that such improvements aren't very reasonable in most cases, and in half a year, I'll still have to buy a new one, losing the $500 invested in the upgrade.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

&amp;#x200B;

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month. I feel that if I do it, all the time spent on finding tips for saving money on Walmart or Costco shopping is wasted. I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

Everybody knows that good clothes, boots or furniture are really the cheapest in the end, although they cost more money at first; but the working classes can seldom or never afford to buy good things; they have to buy cheap rubbish which is dear at any price

I took it to a repair shop for checking, and they told me it could be upgraded for $500, but they only give a three-month warranty.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month.

I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far.

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

It's pretty annoying that I have to wait almost five minutes to open a program and start working.

I took it to a repair shop for checking, and they told me it could be upgraded for $500, but they only give a three-month warranty.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

&amp;#x200B;

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month.

I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far.

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.  Almost without exception, they will send you coupons.

I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.  (Yes, I know...that's rather silly that I didn't think of that, huh?)  


I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.  Almost without exception, they will send you coupons.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.  (Yes, I know...that's rather silly that I didn't think of that, huh?)  


I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.

Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I'm semi-okay with ordering other meats from Walmart, they seem to have ""ok"" chicken and pork for some things.

Mostly I need ground beef/chuck and maybe something like beef tips but I do want to get some chicken and pork.

Optimally I'd like to get all that I need (other non-meat food items included) in one order just because I can't afford delivery charges and tips very often. If I have to though I'll get meat from one place and other items from a walmart delivery if that's the top suggestion.

Any suggestions on which store to shop for beef/ground beef products?  I'm fairly inexperienced with grocery shopping, mom died on christmas eve and now a month later the food in the kitchen is starting to become scarce so I need to figure something out but I need to watch how much I spend and make sure what I get is reasonably good and not a waste of money.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.  (Yes, I know...that's rather silly that I didn't think of that, huh?)  


I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

Even I know this is a poor design choice, but their loss is our frugal gain!  These phones with cracked backs are typically available on Ebay for 75% of new price!  And there is almost nothing wrong with them!    


You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.    


Here is the list I have of Motorola phones with glass back covers, that you'll probably find cheap on ebay

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.

I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

When I mentioned this to a relative of mine they said it was no wonder we eat as well as we do since it never would have occurred to them to do the same and how they would've probably just spent it all on snacks for lack of anything better to buy.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.

I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.

I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

Starting from this month, I will be now making more money than I know what to do with.  I won't be rich by any standard, but I will be pretty comfortable and can start spending on some luxuries.

The thing is, because of my years of struck budgeting and penny-pinching, I don't know how to spend money.

It's like a challenge for myself to spend the least amount of money possible every month.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

When I mentioned this to a relative of mine they said it was no wonder we eat as well as we do since it never would have occurred to them to do the same and how they would've probably just spent it all on snacks for lack of anything better to buy.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I have been working on decluttering my house (simplifying, you know) and so I have mostly used it to give away things to people who are interested, but I have used it a few times to ask for things, too.  


I found a metal tchotchke at a thrift store last week.  It's white, but I want to spray paint it red.  I asked the Buy Nothing group if anyone had a used can of red spray paint that they might be willing to give to me, and within an hour, someone said that they did.  I picked it up at her house the next time I was down in town.  Now I don't have to go out and buy a can of red spray paint that I would probably only use once and then it would just sit on a shelf in the garage gathering dust.  


It's really nice to know that you are able to help people and to receive help on these groups.  Ours is wonderful.  One of the admins just had premature twins and people in the group came to the rescue and made sure that she had premie baby clothes, diapers, and they even brought meals to her.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!

We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

I immediately knew it was stolen and needed to file a report but I procrastinated mostly due to thinking it was a homeless person stealing it and telling myself I was going to stop leaving my possessions of value in my car. 
Well smart fucking me last night, after an 8hour shift, I drop off my manager to her house and go home forgetting I had my backpack in my car. I go check on it at 4 today and it’s fucking gone with my university borrowed laptop, my iPad i bought 2 years ago and all my school notebooks. I’m pretty sure it was the same person, and they left a cheap cloth bag in my front passengers seat like a piece of shit (I’m pretty sure it was on purpose by that point to leave it)

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I picked it up at her house the next time I was down in town.  Now I don't have to go out and buy a can of red spray paint that I would probably only use once and then it would just sit on a shelf in the garage gathering dust.  


It's really nice to know that you are able to help people and to receive help on these groups.  Ours is wonderful.  One of the admins just had premature twins and people in the group came to the rescue and made sure that she had premie baby clothes, diapers, and they even brought meals to her.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!

My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

My friends say that such improvements aren't very reasonable in most cases, and in half a year, I'll still have to buy a new one, losing the $500 invested in the upgrade.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

&amp;#x200B;

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month. I feel that if I do it, all the time spent on finding tips for saving money on Walmart or Costco shopping is wasted. I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

It's not essential, but it causes a certain discomfort and somewhat slows down my work, not to mention the fact that it dramatically spoils my mood. It's pretty annoying that I have to wait almost five minutes to open a program and start working.

I took it to a repair shop for checking, and they told me it could be upgraded for $500, but they only give a three-month warranty. My friends say that such improvements aren't very reasonable in most cases, and in half a year, I'll still have to buy a new one, losing the $500 invested in the upgrade.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

&amp;#x200B;

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month. I feel that if I do it, all the time spent on finding tips for saving money on Walmart or Costco shopping is wasted. I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

Everybody knows that good clothes, boots or furniture are really the cheapest in the end, although they cost more money at first; but the working classes can seldom or never afford to buy good things; they have to buy cheap rubbish which is dear at any price

I took it to a repair shop for checking, and they told me it could be upgraded for $500, but they only give a three-month warranty.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month.

I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far.

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

It's pretty annoying that I have to wait almost five minutes to open a program and start working.

I took it to a repair shop for checking, and they told me it could be upgraded for $500, but they only give a three-month warranty.

&amp;#x200B;

After looking at the offers on the market, I chose a model that meets my requirements, but the price, to put it mildly, is not encouraging. And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

&amp;#x200B;

Being frugal for two years already, spending $2k on a new computer seems like a luxury purchase, especially when I don't surpass $1200 per month.

I constantly monitor my apps, hoping to find discounts on computers, but no results so far.

I'm adding the laptop to my cart every time I make online orders, but I remove it from the list when ending my purchase. Even though I understand that spending $2K on a notebook is an investment in my future, I still can't buy it. My GF says that my thrift is unhealthy, and I need help.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

And even worse, the price in different stores is almost the same. The maximum difference is $10. I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.  Almost without exception, they will send you coupons.

I'm afraid to order this model on aliexpress where the price is several hundred lower since I already had a bad experience buying electronics on this site. Buying a used one isn't an option either.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.  (Yes, I know...that's rather silly that I didn't think of that, huh?)  


I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.  Almost without exception, they will send you coupons.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.  (Yes, I know...that's rather silly that I didn't think of that, huh?)  


I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.

Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I'm semi-okay with ordering other meats from Walmart, they seem to have ""ok"" chicken and pork for some things.

Mostly I need ground beef/chuck and maybe something like beef tips but I do want to get some chicken and pork.

Optimally I'd like to get all that I need (other non-meat food items included) in one order just because I can't afford delivery charges and tips very often. If I have to though I'll get meat from one place and other items from a walmart delivery if that's the top suggestion.

Any suggestions on which store to shop for beef/ground beef products?  I'm fairly inexperienced with grocery shopping, mom died on christmas eve and now a month later the food in the kitchen is starting to become scarce so I need to figure something out but I need to watch how much I spend and make sure what I get is reasonably good and not a waste of money.

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.  Someone commented on another post that I made this morning about discovering that I didn't care for this one brand of cottage cheese that I had bought -- they said that I should contact the company.  I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.  (Yes, I know...that's rather silly that I didn't think of that, huh?)  


I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

Even I know this is a poor design choice, but their loss is our frugal gain!  These phones with cracked backs are typically available on Ebay for 75% of new price!  And there is almost nothing wrong with them!    


You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.    


Here is the list I have of Motorola phones with glass back covers, that you'll probably find cheap on ebay

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.

I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

When I mentioned this to a relative of mine they said it was no wonder we eat as well as we do since it never would have occurred to them to do the same and how they would've probably just spent it all on snacks for lack of anything better to buy.

You have two options for a cracked glass back phone:    


1.  Replace the back cover.  This is a trivial operation and costs about $10-20 bucks. Then put it in a case to keep it from happening again.   

2. Duct tape it.  Put it in a case to keep it from happening again.  It's good to go.  I'm pretty sure this isn't dangerous because the glass is already attached to some kind of substrate, the duct tape keeps it together and the case protects it from ever being sharp.  But if you are worried see option 1.

I am looking for a little advice from the group. Generally, I am a very frugal person, I'm in my 30s with enough passive income to live without having a job, but after 2 years nearly since being laid off from the covid shutdowns, I got bored of being home all the time, so I sought a dream job doing something I enjoy over chasing a career for maximum income, but this job is 45mins each direction. I drive a 2016 Chevy Colorado w/2.8L Diesel 4x4 because one of my hobbies I do about once a month I enjoy going camping for 2-3 days riding my UTV with friends and other groups, so I need something that can still tow and make it through some muddy trails at times, so awd/4x4 is preferred. 

I thought about selling my place to move closer to the dream job to reduce the cost of driving so far, but just to get into something equal to what I have now, it would cost me at least 200k+ more than what I could sell my current place due to the area being more expensive near the dream job. 

I have been contemplating selling the truck and moving over to an electric vehicle, but unsure if it is truly the best route for me, but I do have solar on the house, which greatly reduces my cost for electricity. The local tesla dealer offered me 41k for my truck as it is now used towards a new Model Y. 

Anyways, wanted to get some opinions from the masses, I thought about saving a little and picking up one of the 2016 Model X's I see for sale sometimes for around 48-50k, because it has a higher tow rating, but I have also thought about moving to a cheaper car version of tesla, then once a month rent a truck to tow with.

Today being the last of January, I wanted to give an update.

Now, to start off, I SUCK at budgeting. I have PTSD and as most of us, have felt extremely lonely these past two years, and have undergone extreme changes in my life throughout the pandemic (graduated college, bought my first car, officially moved out of my parents, etc). My spending habits 1000% reflect the uncertainty, loneliness, and overall confusion about what I’m doing with my life.

This is blatant now as I look at my expenses for the month. I am going to be very honest, so please do not judge me or bring negativity. I grew up a poor immigrant so this is my first time in the real world with my own money. 

I have no dependents and have no experience budgeting. In order to start in a way that felt natural for me, I split my spending into the following categories, based off of what I use my money on the most:

1. Bills: rent, car payments, credit card payment, utilities, as gas, medical bills, and I included laundry related expenses here too.
2. Food: self explanatory. Groceries &amp; take out.
3. Savings
4. Fun: shopping, bars, vices
5. Miscellaneous: parking, beauty &amp; wellness supplies


I am shocked!! To see how much I spend. I would like to get to a point where I spend no more than $500 monthly on food, fun, and miscellaneous items. Currently I am spending almost an entire two weeks worth of work in these three categories. 

After logging all of my daily expenses, I wrote about all of my “Fun” transactions and whether the experiences had been worth the cost. I wanna say out of 12 transactions I could only justify 4 or so of them. The others I did because the night is young, I thought.

I am a bit worried about the coming month because my birthday is coming up and I am basically booked every weekend with dinners and have a trip coming up. I am grateful of course, but nervous about overspending.",1643676136,January Expenses Tracking Update,0,1.0

I bought some Life cereal about a month or so ago.  I don't often buy dry cereal, but I really like Life cereal and so I bought two boxes (they were on sale).  The first box was just fine, but the second box was FULL of crumbs!  I actually took the time to separate the good from the bad and I weighed them so that I could email the company and let them know how unhappy I was with all of those crumbs.  They sent me coupons for two free boxes of Life.

I'm going to do that!  It hadn't occurred to me that I could do this with a food item that I had never bought before and realized that I didn't like it.

I bought a Bissell hand-held vacuum this past summer.  We used it once (we used it to vacuum out the area where the screen fits into the windows -- we were cleaning the windows) and when it came time to empty the canister, we could NOT get it to click back into place.  We both tried and it was just NOT working.  So I contacted Bissell and explained the problem to them.  They sent me a brand new one!  They didn't even want the defective one back.  My husband said that he can duct tape the broken one and still use it, so now we have one for the garage AND one for the inside of the house.

I don't know the statistic, but I read somewhere that when you contact a company about their product, your call actually represents MANY more customers than you realize. Most companies are glad to hear from you.  They want to keep you as a customer and they will try to make it right with you.  


Also, contact the companies of products that you really like.  Tell them how much you like their product.  Ask them if they have any coupons for that particular product that they could send to you.

Eventually I was able to get out of debt by strict budgeting.  *Extremely strict budgeting*.  With that I was able to buy a condo, and start saving some money on top.

But for the past few years I've been making more than I need, and I've been putting the savings into paying down my mortgage faster, and starting saving for retirement.

Starting from this month, I will be now making more money than I know what to do with.  I won't be rich by any standard, but I will be pretty comfortable and can start spending on some luxuries.

The thing is, because of my years of struck budgeting and penny-pinching, I don't know how to spend money.  For example, my credit card bill for January is going to be around $170, and that's pretty much just gas and internet.  It's like a challenge for myself to spend the least amount of money possible every month.

Does anyone have some advice on how to change my mentality on spending so I don't feel bad when I buy something new?  I don't have any desire to go back to the wild ways of my 20s, but I would like to start enjoying life a bit more.",1643489032,"I have been extremely frugal for the past many years, does anyone have advice on how to be a bit less frugal?",0,1.0

(As an example, the yogurt I usually buy is $2.18 at my preferred store but at this high-end store it's $6.99 for the exact same brand/flavor/quantity.)

Rather than waste the money on misc weekly groceries, I jotted down a list of five items I like to buy but don't because of their high cost. In the end, it was decided it would be nice to have ham since we -my husband, kiddo, and I- usually only get it once a year. I looked online for this store's weekly ad and bided my time for ham to go on sale. One a week I would check the ad (which sounds like a lot but it really only took up maybe two to three minutes of my day).

Around here, shank ham portions normally go for $3.99/lb to $5.99/lb but this past week it was a much more reasonable $1.29/lb. I coordinated my trip with other errands I had to do and was able to score three ten(ish) pound hams for $12 to $13 each. I also picked up two large containers of salsa since these are a shelf stable item we use frequently. Altogether, with tax, my out of pocket cost was $4.35.

The plan is to freeze two hams and cook one. The one which is cooked will be sliced using a $7 meat slicer we found at the thrift store last year, portioned and bagged and labeled, then moved to the fridge/freezer as we see fit. The leftover ham bone will be made into split pea soup (using a yet-to-be-acquired recipe from my mother-in-law).

When I mentioned this to a relative of mine they said it was no wonder we eat as well as we do since it never would have occurred to them to do the same and how they would've probably just spent it all on snacks for lack of anything better to buy.
