Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

A lot of times they'll even have organic or otherwise high end food that for one reason or another they have a surplus of. Naked juice, Halo top, grassmilk (absolutely on love with that brand now), etc. 

If you're having trouble with food security and are in the state of MN please you can [find your closest distribution center here](https://www.rubyspantry.org/find-location)",1642743432,For Minnesotans feeling a little food insecure.,0,1.0

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

What are your grocery habits like? Do you try to save every penny possible, every trip? Or do you buy organic produce and veg but the cheap eggs and margarine? Do you only buy the expensive stuff on discount or do you have habitual things you spend more on?

Personally, I end up being less frugal with my grocery than I would like because I've recently been subject to some unfortunate medical eating restrictions and it's been difficult to adjust the way I eat without picking more expensive substitutes.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas. You can potentially free up hundreds of dollars a month if you plan ahead.",1642886306,"If you spend too much on takeout and restaurant food, try this tip.",0,1.0

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

I was looking into Amazon for traffic cones to place as boundaries at the end of the driveway (where the driveway and sidewalk meet) and notice how expensive the heavy duty, legit traffic cones are. Is there a place that might be selling these in bulk for a cheaper price? A place possibly giving any old ones away? Or any other ideas you might have.

Usually you get a gallon or two of milk, bread, a lot of potatoes (a metric f*** ton of potatoes), rice, and meat.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

What are your grocery habits like? Do you try to save every penny possible, every trip? Or do you buy organic produce and veg but the cheap eggs and margarine? Do you only buy the expensive stuff on discount or do you have habitual things you spend more on?

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

What are your grocery habits like? Do you try to save every penny possible, every trip? Or do you buy organic produce and veg but the cheap eggs and margarine? Do you only buy the expensive stuff on discount or do you have habitual things you spend more on?

Personally, I end up being less frugal with my grocery than I would like because I've recently been subject to some unfortunate medical eating restrictions and it's been difficult to adjust the way I eat without picking more expensive substitutes.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas. You can potentially free up hundreds of dollars a month if you plan ahead.",1642886306,"If you spend too much on takeout and restaurant food, try this tip.",0,1.0

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

What are your grocery habits like? Do you try to save every penny possible, every trip? Or do you buy organic produce and veg but the cheap eggs and margarine? Do you only buy the expensive stuff on discount or do you have habitual things you spend more on?

Personally, I end up being less frugal with my grocery than I would like because I've recently been subject to some unfortunate medical eating restrictions and it's been difficult to adjust the way I eat without picking more expensive substitutes.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas. You can potentially free up hundreds of dollars a month if you plan ahead.",1642886306,"If you spend too much on takeout and restaurant food, try this tip.",0,1.0

_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me. 

Basically, I just need some advice. I'm ""retirement rich"" but does that mean anything? How much do you want to have? I just want to have enough to live, be generous, help my kids/grandkids, etc.",1642896983,Retirement Advice Go Forward,0,1.0

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

What are your grocery habits like? Do you try to save every penny possible, every trip? Or do you buy organic produce and veg but the cheap eggs and margarine? Do you only buy the expensive stuff on discount or do you have habitual things you spend more on?

Personally, I end up being less frugal with my grocery than I would like because I've recently been subject to some unfortunate medical eating restrictions and it's been difficult to adjust the way I eat without picking more expensive substitutes.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas. You can potentially free up hundreds of dollars a month if you plan ahead.",1642886306,"If you spend too much on takeout and restaurant food, try this tip.",0,1.0

_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me. 

Basically, I just need some advice. I'm ""retirement rich"" but does that mean anything? How much do you want to have? I just want to have enough to live, be generous, help my kids/grandkids, etc.",1642896983,Retirement Advice Go Forward,0,1.0

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

Takeout food is usually not too difficult to replicate well enough to at least scratch the itch, and getting one takeout meal delivered with fees and tip can approach $35 in some areas.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Im 26 and married. Had $144K in student debt at 21 and paid off in March 2020. My wifes income got cut to about 15-20K a year due to covid. She also teaches at a school we helped start for free, which is why she hasnt gotten a different job that pays more. We are comfortable with the large decrease in pay because we believe in the mission. 

I make about $90K in tech at a stable and legacy company. Expectation is for my income to increase to 97-100K next year, and then maybe 105 the following. 

We have been tremendously frugal. We have about 140K in retirement accounts, no consumer debt. We did just buy a house for $277K. This sits around 30% of my takehome and is comfortable. My cashflow on my income alone is $2000 a month.   


I feel like we should figure out what to do. We have been vigorously saving and investing, but we really dont know how much we actually need. I also feel like its slightly futile. I dont want to live it up in the moment, but i am afraid of spending anything basically. 

Our spending is about $27,000 a year right now, will increase once we have a mortgage to probably close to $34K. I currently invest $26,550 annually. 

Math:

If i get 8% a year and only put in 6K IRA per year from this point on we should have roughly $4.1M at 65. No clue obviously what inflation will do.

I just dont really know if i should keep going really hard or chill out, enjoy the house and vacations and whatnot. 

FI/RE is actually quite a struggle. I have zero interest in just sitting around. I believe we are made to work, and I enjoy providing value to people. If I retired early, I would probably volunteer or do things that matter to me.

Keep track of the restaurant/takeout foods you frequently crave and keep easy-to-make, cheaper stuff with a similar flavor profile around your place. I always have a variety of staple convenience meals in stock with a variety of flavor profiles just in case I don’t feel like cooking and am craving something. It also really helps to invest in equipment designed to increase convenience (e.g., air fryer, Instant Pot, rice cookers), and to meal prep your favorite foods when you have the time and money and save the meals in the freezer for a rainy day. 

So if you frequently crave Thai food, keep jarred sauce/curry paste/coconut milk and frozen chicken in stock. Indian stores often sell a variety of totally decent frozen meals for a good price if you frequently crave Indian food. Tonkotsu broth packets for ramen are usually pretty good and inexpensive. Burgers? Keep patties, buns, and frozen fries in your freezer. And so on. Check out ethnic grocery stores and look online for maximum options.

What about tools and time? I frequently DIY things on my cars, so I’ve decided to analyze a recent project using my actual numbers and a few different scenarios so you can decide for yourself if the benefit is there.


_The Project:_ 2007 Mazda3 2.3l Front Suspension Refresh. Specifically, replacing the lower control arms (non-serviceable ball joints), outer tie rods (aka tie rod ends), and struts.


_Dealer Quote: $1750 plus tax from a reputable and reasonable dealer I’ve used before. The specific breakdown is about $1000 of labor and the remainder is OEM parts. I didn’t get a quote from one of my favored independent shops because it’s rude to waste their time when they won’t get the business, but let’s assume they’d only charge $800 in labor and buy the same aftermarket parts I did (see below). That makes their best-case scenario about $1225, which in my opinion would be a good deal.


_My Actual Money Costs:_ Total = $425 (rounded up numbers for simplicity). Tie rod ends $21/each (Moog), control arms $70/each (Mevotech), complete quickstrut assembly $110/each (KYB), plus shipping. Purchased from RockAuto. There is also a future cost of about $100 for an alignment, but that would be the same no matter who did the work, so I’m excluding it from the analysis.


_Tool Costs:_ This is where it starts to get complicated. I own quite a lot of tools so the only tool cost was a new grease gun and grease, which was optional on this job because I could have opted for parts with sealed fittings instead of greaseable fittings. But let’s just say my additional tool cost was $100 (I bought a nice Lincoln gun and paid retail at NAPA, eww). But what if you were brand new to this? What would your total tool costs be?


_Hypothetical Tool Costs:_ If I were starting from scratch and shopping at Harbor Freight I would need/want the following - costs are rounded off/up. Jack ($100), jack stands* ($50), metric socket set ($15), ratchet ($20), metric wrench set ($25), metric Allen wrench set ($2), pry bar ($15), pickle fork ($10), torque wrench ($25), needle nose pliers ($5), large adjustable wrench ($15), 3lb sledgehammer ($10) and miscellaneous supplies ($20). That comes to right around $310. Alternately, you could buy one of the mechanic toolsets ($200) which comes with most of that and much more, and spend about $400 altogether but be better supplied for next time. I also didn’t include a cordless impact, because this can all easily be done without one, but I highly recommend one if this is something you might do regularly. If that were the case you could also consider better tools than HF, but they’ll do a job like this just fine and a few more after that.


_Time Costs:_ My wife actually did most of this job because it’s her car. She works painfully slowly because she’s new at it, which makes her perfect for this example. Overall, working by herself, it would have most likely taken her about 10 hours total. That makes her “compensation” compared to hiring it out $80-100 per hour. That is definitely more than either of us makes at our job. I would have probably done it in about 5 hours, making my “compensation” $160-200/hour. Nice!


_Other Considerations:_ This isn’t a particularly dangerous job (to you or the car) but it’s always possible to get injured or do damage to the vehicle, so there’s some risk there. You need to have suitable, level workspace that’s not too hot or cold to work in. You might really not like doing this kind of thing and maybe it’s not worth it if you hate every minute. You need to actually have the time to do it, and that’s not something everyone has. It’s also very possible to get stuck on something or not have the right tool, so it’s important to have resources on hand like shop manuals, pictures, YouTube videos, walkthroughs from a forum, or an experienced friend. It’s also good to have a plan for alternate transportation if you need to go get a part or tool, or it takes longer than you thought and you have to go somewhere. The worst-case scenario (barring serious injury) is that you get *so* stuck you have to get it towed somewhere and pay for it after all, so it’s good to know in advance what that might cost for peace of mind at least (I’ve never had to do this, even when I was young and very stupid, but it’s a comfort to know you could).


TL;DR: Did medium-difficulty car maintenance and saved $800-$1325 with 5-10 hours of labor. Adding in “starting from scratch” tool costs, hypothetical savings are were still $500-$1025.

Checking in to see if anyone has any tricks on how to save money (Certain type of heater, etc.) or if anyone has the same setup and has figured a way to save. Thanks",1642705401,Ways to save money heating my house?,0,1.0

These are consistently the most expensive thing on my grocery list (aside from other proteins) and even when buying in bulk they are always $$$. I’m talking any “nut”, walnuts, pecans, cashews, peanuts (yes I know they are a legume), Brazil nuts, etc. How do you buy them? Shelled or unshelled? Roasted or raw? Local or online bulk?

I'd had it maybe two years and didn't actually use it all that often until we moved someplace that had all tile floors. I've got a dog that tracks in lots of dirt/mud and even with cleaning his feet, the floors get gross. Slobber, drips (TMI intact male dog so... you know), he's a mess. I need something that will get up dirty pet messes. Preferably that will last and not immediately break but also won't kill my back.
